 - Xiang Liu (50%)
   - did Hyperparameter fine-tuning in CNN model with custom model and VGG-16. 
 - Ashley Mercado (50%)
   - worked on both the SVM and the pre-trained ViT model by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
 - We did report evenlly.
### Note:
 - We created 19 Brunchs cause we did not how to combine them. And because we did model individually, we worked on local and upload final versions.
